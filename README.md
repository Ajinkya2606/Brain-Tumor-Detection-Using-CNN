# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-CNN
This project aims to develop an accurate and efficient system for detecting brain tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Utilizing deep learning techniques, the model is trained on a dataset of brain MRI images, which are categorized into two classes: healthy and tumor. The goal is to enable quick and reliable detection of brain tumors.
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is organized into two main directories:

Training
Contains images for training the model, with subdirectories for each class (Healthy and Tumor).
Validation
Contains images for validating the model performance, with the same subdirectory structure.
